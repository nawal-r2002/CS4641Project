## Introduction
The capability of the nervous system to effectively control muscles to maintain balance in response to disturbances to the body is crucial for survival. Several neural pathways in the brainstem and spinal cord generate sensorimotor responses, but it is unclear how cortical activity from the brain contributes to these motor responses.

Recordings from the cortex using electroencephalography (EEG) have revealed a large, negative peak of cortical activity, N1, known as an error assessment signal evoked when external stimuli cause an unexpected error from the upright posture [1]. 

A general framework for decoding neural signals has been established by Saeidi, et al. This involves using Wavelet Transform (WT) to convert raw recordings into wavelets that localize features and remove noise. Since wavelets are often high dimensional, PCA and other dimensionality reduction algorithms are used to preprocess the data before it is fed into the machine learning algorithm of choice [2]. We plan on using a similar pipeline in our project. However, since our project is mainly focused on cortical N1 activity, our preprocessing will involve transforming raw EEG signals into a vector of characteristic parameters that describe the cortical N1 activity using a neuromechanical model as opposed to WT.

Our dataset includes 6 experimental recordings (6 conditions: 2 directions and 3 magnitudes of balance perturbation) of EEG and EMG per participant, collected from 36 participants (19 healthy old adults, 17 Parkinsonâ€™s Disease patients) in the Emory Rehabilitation Hospital. This results in 216 data points in total. 

## Problem Definition
Our goal for this study is to develop predictive models in order to accurately forecast the characteristic parameters of muscle activity based on the characteristic parameters of the cortical N1 activity. This approach aims to enhance our ability to investigate changes in cortical contributions to balance control in aging and impairment.
